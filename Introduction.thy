Meet Schr\"odinger, who travels the world with an unusually clever clowder of
$n$ talking cats. In their latest show, the cats stand in a line.
Schr\"odinger asks a volunteer to take $n+1$ hats, numbered zero to $n$, and
randomly assign one to each cat, so that there is one spare. Each cat sees all
of the hats in front of it, but not its own hat, nor those behind, nor the
spare hat. The cats then take turns, each saying a single number from the set
$\setc*{i}{0 \leq i \leq n}$, without repeating any number said previously, and
without any other communication. The cats are allowed a single incorrect guess,
but otherwise every cat must say the number on its own hat.

section \<open>Introduction\<close>

text \<open>

In this article, we will figure out how the cats do this. We'll start with some
informal analysis, deriving the solution by asking what properties it must
have, and refining these properties until we can realise them with a concrete
algorithm. We'll also develop a formal proof that the method always works,
using Isabelle/HOL.

Along the way, we'll rediscover a fundamental property of permutation groups,
and we'll gain some familiarity with some basic methods of formal mathematical
proof.

Although this is not intended as an Isabelle/HOL tutorial, we hope that it is
accessible to readers with no formal theorem proving experience. We do assume
familiarity with some fundamentals of functional programming and classical
logic.\footnote{Some exposure to Haskell, ML or similar, predicate logic with
quantifiers, and naive set theory should be adequate.} We won't explain the
detailed steps required to prove each lemma, but we will explain how each lemma
fits into the overall progression of the proof.

For the informal analysis, we'll work from the top down, gradually unfolding
the solution. Each refinement will be small, and may seem like it is the only
possible step. As we do this, we'll use Isabelle/HOL to make each step of the
analysis more precise, and to check that our reasoning is sound.

However, there's a problem with this approach: our proof is inherently bottom
up, building from the solution we ultimately identify, to a theorem that it
solves the puzzle. We do not attempt to show that our solution is the
\emph{only} possible solution, although our informal analysis suggests that it
is.

To develop the proof as we work top down, we need a way to invert the proof.
We'll do this by temporarily \emph{assuming} things we believe must be true for
the puzzle to have a solution, but which we don't yet know how to prove. But
we'll typically need to carry these assumptions through many lemmas. So, to
avoid repeating assumptions, we'll use the \isacommand{locale} mechanism of
Isabelle/HOL to create named bundles of assumptions. Later, we'll discharge our
assumptions using locale \emph{interpretataion}.

Our first locale, @{text hats}, describes the basic setup of the
puzzle:\footnote{When reading Isabelle/HOL, you may ignore double quotes. They
are there for technical reasons which have very little to do with the
specification or proof you are reading.}

\<close>

locale hats =
  -- "the spare hat"
  fixes spare :: "nat"
  -- "hats assigned to cats, in order from back to front"
  fixes assigned :: "nat list"
  -- "the set of all hat numbers"
  assumes assign: "set (spare # assigned) = {0 .. length assigned}"

text \<open>

The @{term hats} locale takes two \emph{parameters} introduced with
\isacommand{fixes} declarations:

\begin{itemize}

  \item @{text spare}, of type @{typ nat}, represents the number of the spare
  hat,

  \item @{text assigned}, of type @{typ nat} @{text "list"},\footnote{In
  Isabelle/HOL, type constructor application is written right-to-left, so a
  @{typ nat} @{text "list"} is a list of natural numbers.} represents the hats
  assigned to cats, in order from back to front.

\end{itemize}

By \emph{parameter}, we mean a placeholder for an arbitrary value of the given
type. It is bound, or fixed, to the locale, so every mention of it in the
locale context refers to the same hypothetical value. The \isacommand{fixes}
declaration does not specify \emph{which} value, although subsequent locale
assumptions may have the effect of restricting the possible values of
parameters.

The @{term hats} locale also has an \isacommand{assumes} declaration, which
introduces an assumption named @{text assign}. It asserts that if we take the
set of all hats, including the @{text spare} and @{text assigned}
hats,\footnote{The @{text #} constructor builds a new list from an existing
element and list; and the @{text set} function converts a @{text list} to an
unordered @{text set} type.} then we have the set of natural numers from @{text
"0"} up to the number of @{text assigned} hats, inclusive.  This specifies the
possible hat numbers, but because we use unordered sets, it does not say
anything about the order of @{text assigned} hats, nor which is the @{text
spare} hat.

We can now prove lemmas in the context of the @{term hats} locale, which means
that these lemmas can talk about the @{text spare} and @{text assigned} hats,
and implicitly make the @{text assign} assumption.

For example, from this assumption, we can show that the hats all have distinct
numbers:

\<close>

lemma (in hats) "distinct (spare # assigned)"
  proof -
    -- "We start by restating our locale assumption."
    have "set (spare # assigned) = {0 .. length assigned}"
      by (rule assign)
    -- "We apply the @{text card} (set cardinality) function to both sides."
    hence "card (set (spare # assigned)) = card {0 .. length assigned}"
      by (rule arg_cong[where f=card])
    -- "We substitute an equivalent right-hand side, using built-in simplifications."
    hence "card (set (spare # assigned)) = 1 + length assigned"
      by simp
    -- "We substitute another right-hand side."
    hence "card (set (spare # assigned)) = length (spare # assigned)"
      by simp
    -- "The library fact @{text card_distinct} says a list is distinct
        if its length equals the cardinality of its set."
    thus "distinct (spare # assigned)"
      by (rule card_distinct)
  qed

text \<open>

The above proof contains much more detail than Isabelle/HOL requires. In the
rest of this article, we'll write much terser individual proofs, since we want
to focus on the higher-level development.

For example, we could shorten this proof as follows:

\<close>

lemma (in hats) distinct_hats: "distinct (spare # assigned)"
  by (rule card_distinct, subst assign, simp)

text \<open>

We've also given the lemma a name, @{text distinct_hats}, so we can refer to
the proven fact later.

\<close>

section \<open>Taking turns\<close>

text \<open>

The rules require each cat to say exactly one hat number, but do not specify
the order in which they do this. We can see that the order we choose affects
the distribution of information:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Visible information remains constant over time, but cats towards the
  rear see more than cats towards the front.

  \item Audible information accumulates over time, but at any particular point
  in time, all cats have heard the same things.

\end{itemize}

We observe that the cats can only ever communicate information \emph{forwards},
never backwards:

\begin{itemize}

  \item When a cat chooses a number, all of the information available to it is
  already known to all the cats behind it. Therefore, cats towards the rear can
  never learn anything from the choices made by cats towards the front.

  \item However, cats towards the front \emph{can} learn things from choices
  made by cats towards the rear, because those choices might encode knowledge
  of hats which are not visible from the front.

\end{itemize}

We propose that the cats should take turns from the rearmost towards the front,
ensuring that:

\begin{itemize}

  \item The cat making the choice is always the one with the most information.

  \item We maximise the amount each cat can learn before it makes its choice.

\end{itemize}

We'll use another locale, and some definitions in the locale context, to
describe the information flow:

\<close>

locale cats = hats +
  -- "Numbers said by the cats, in order from back to front."
  fixes spoken :: "nat list"
  -- "Each cat speaks exactly once."
  assumes length: "length spoken = length assigned"

-- "Each cat hears what was said by the cats behind it."
definition (in cats) "heard k \<equiv> take k spoken"

-- "Each cat sees the @{text assigned} hats in front of it."
definition (in cats) "seen k \<equiv> drop (Suc k) assigned"

text \<open>

Informally, the declaration says that there is a list of numbers @{text spoken}
by the cats, which is just as long as the list of @{text assigned} hats. We
define functions @{term heard} and @{term seen}, such that @{text heard} @{text
k} and @{text seen} @{text k} are the lists of numbers heard and seen by cat
@{text k}.

The only remarkable thing about the @{term cats} locale is that it
\emph{extends} the @{term hats} locale. This means that the \isacommand{fixes}
and \isacommand{assumes} declarations from the @{term hats} locale become
available in the context of the @{term cats} locale. Lemmas proved in the
@{term hats} locale also become available in the @{term cats} locale, whether
they were proved before or after the @{term cats} locale declaration.

Why did we not make these \isacommand{fixes} and \isacommand{assumes}
declarations in the @{term hats} locale? Eventually, we want to discharge the
@{text length} assumption, but we can never discharge the @{text assign}
assumption. As we'll see later, this means we need a separate locale.

\<close>

section \<open>The rearmost cat\<close>

text \<open>

Each cat sees the hats in front of it, and hears the calls made by those behind
it, but otherwise receives no information. In particular, no cat knows the
rearmost cat's number. Until Schr\"odinger reveals it at the end of the
performance, it could be either of the two hats that are invisible to all cats.

To guarantee success, the cats must therefore assume the worst: that the
rearmost cat got it wrong. But this means that all the other cats \emph{must}
get it right!

The role of the rearmost cat is therefore not to try to guess his own hat, but
to pass the right information to the other cats.

\<close>

section \<open>Reasoning by induction\<close>

text \<open>

Knowing which cats must get it right makes our job easier, since we don't need
to keep track of whether the cats have used up their free pass. When
considering how some cat $k$ makes its choice, we can assume that all the cats
$\setc{i}{0 < i < k}$, i.e.\ those behind it, except the rearmost, have already
made the right choices.

This might seem like circular reasoning, but it's not. In principle, we build
up what we know from the rearmost cat, one cat at a time towards the front,
using what we've already shown about cats $\setc{i}{0 \leq i < k}$ when we're
proving that cat $k$ makes the right choice. Mathematical induction merely says
that if all steps are alike, we can take an arbitrary number of them all at
once, by considering an arbitrary cat $k$, and assuming we've already
considered all the cats $\setc{i}{0 \leq i < k}$ behind it.

We'll use a locale to package up the so-called \emph{induction hypothesis}.
That is, we'll fix some cat @{text k}, which is not the rearmost cat, and
assume that all the cats behind it, except the rearmost cat, said the correct
number:\footnote{Infix operator @{text "!"} retrieves the @{text nth} element
from a @{text list}; and @{text "{a..<b}"} is the set $\setc{n}{a \leq n <
b}$.}

\<close>

locale cat_k = cats +
  fixes k :: "nat"
  assumes k_min: "0 < k"
  assumes k_max: "k < length assigned"
  assumes IH: "\<forall>i \<in> {1 ..< k}. spoken ! i = assigned ! i"

text \<open>

Using this, we can already formalise the induction argument:

\<close>

lemma (in cats) cat_k_induct:
  assumes "\<And>k. cat_k spare assigned spoken k \<Longrightarrow> spoken ! k = assigned ! k"
  shows "k \<in> {1 ..< length assigned} \<Longrightarrow> spoken ! k = assigned ! k"
  apply (induct k rule: nat_less_induct)
  apply (rule assms)
  apply (unfold_locales)
  by auto

text \<open>

This says that, in the @{term cats} locale, if every cat satisfying @{term
cat_k} says the correct number, then every cat except the rearmost says the
correct number. We get the induction hypothesis for free!

Note the keywords \isacommand{assumes} and \isacommand{shows} in the
\isacommand{lemma} statement. The first allows us to make additional
assumptions for this lemma. The second introduces the thing we want to prove
from the assumptions. If we have no local \isacommand{assumes} declarations, we
can omit the \isacommand{shows} keyword, as we did in @{text distict_hats}.
Logically, an assumption introduced with \isacommand{assumes} is identical to
one introduced with the implication arrow (@{text "\<Longrightarrow>"}). Which
to use is a matter of aesthetics.

In @{text cat_k_induct}, we've slightly abused the locale mechanism, by using
the @{term cat_k} locale as a logical predicate applied to some arguments. We
only do this a couple of times, but it saves us from having to repeat the
induction hypothesis many times.

As an example of something we can prove \emph{within} the @{term cat_k} locale,
we show that the tail of @{text heard} @{text k} can be rewritten in terms of
the @{text assigned} hats:\footnote{Keyword @{text op} turns an infix operator
into a prefix function.}

section \<open>Candidate selection\<close>

text \<open>

According to the rules, no cat may repeat a number already said by another cat
behind it. With a little thought, we can also say that no cat may call a number
that it can see ahead of it. If it did, there would be at least two incorrect
calls.

To see this, suppose some cat $k$ said a number that it saw on the hat of $t$
who is in front of $k$. Hat numbers are unique, so $k$'s number must be
different from $t$'s, and therefore $k$'s choice is wrong. But $t$ may not
repeat the number that $k$ said, so $t$ is also wrong.

Each cat $k$ therefore has to choose between exactly two candidate hats: those left over
after excluding all the numbers it has seen and heard:

\<close>

definition
  candidates_excluding :: "nat list \<Rightarrow> nat list \<Rightarrow> nat set"
where
  "candidates_excluding heard seen \<equiv>
    let excluded = heard @ seen in {0 .. 1 + length excluded} - set excluded"

definition (in cats)
  "candidates k \<equiv> candidates_excluding (heard k) (seen k)"

lemma (in cats) candidates_i:
  fixes a b i
  defines v: "view \<equiv> (a # heard i @ b # seen i)"
  assumes i: "i < length assigned"
  assumes d: "distinct view"
  assumes s: "set view = {0..length assigned}"
  shows "candidates i = {a,b}"
  proof -
    let ?excluded = "heard i @ seen i"
    have len: "1 + length ?excluded = length assigned"
      unfolding heard_def seen_def using i length by auto
    have set: "set ?excluded = {0..length assigned} - {a,b}"

      unfolding len set
      unfolding Diff_Diff_Int subset_absorb_r
      using s unfolding v
      by auto
  qed

text \<open>

Since none of the cats $\setc{i}{0 \leq i < k}$ previously said $k$'s number,
$k$'s own number is one of those candidates. Taking into account our assumption
that all those $\setc{i}{0 < i < k}$ except the rearmost said their own
numbers, we can also say that the other candidate will be the same number which
the rearmost cat chose \emph{not} to call.

To solve the puzzle, we therefore just need to ensure that every cat $k$
rejects the same number that the rearmost cat rejected.

To formalise this, we'll first prove that the @{text candidates} for the rearmost
cat are as we expect:

\<close>

locale cat_0 = cats +
  assumes exists_0: "0 < length assigned"

sublocale cat_k < cat_0
  apply unfold_locales
  using k_min k_max
  by auto

lemma (in cat_0) assigned_0: "assigned ! 0 # drop (Suc 0) assigned = assigned"
  using Cons_nth_drop_Suc[OF exists_0] by simp

lemma (in cat_0) candidates_0: "candidates 0 = {spare, assigned ! 0}"
  apply (rule candidates_i[OF exists_0])
  using distinct_hats assign unfolding heard_def seen_def assigned_0
  by auto

text \<open>

We define the @{text rejected} has as whichever of those the rearmost cat does
not choose:

\<close>

definition (in cat_0)
  "rejected \<equiv> if spoken ! 0 = spare then assigned ! 0 else spare"

text \<open>

We can try to prove a similar theorem for cat $k$, but we discover that we need
some additional assumptions that the expected @{text candidates}, together with
what cat $k$ has @{text heard} and @{text seen}, constitute the complete set of
hats.

We express these assumptions with an abbreviation @{text view_k}. We'll discharge
the assumptions by proving that this is an ordering of the complete set of hats.

\<close>

text \<open>

We'll prove the assumptions by appealing to two other orderings of the complete
set of hats. We'll use @{text view_0} as a step towards @{text view_n}. The latter
is very close to the ordering used in the original specification of @{text hats},
so we can easily prove the relevant properties of @{text view_n}

\<close>

abbreviation (in cat_0) (input) "view_n \<equiv> spare # assigned ! 0 # seen 0"
abbreviation (in cat_0) (input) "view_0 \<equiv> rejected # spoken ! 0 # seen 0"
abbreviation (in cat_k) (input) "view_k \<equiv> rejected # heard k @ assigned ! k # seen k"

lemma (in cat_0)
  distinct_n: "distinct view_n" and
  set_n: "set view_n = {0..length assigned}"
  using distinct_hats assign
  unfolding seen_def assigned_0
  by auto

text \<open>

Ordering @{text view_0} is the same as @{text view_k}, but seen from the rearmost
cat's perspective. We prove they are equal:

\<close>

lemmas (in cat_k) drop_maps =
  drop_map_nth[OF less_imp_le_nat, OF k_max]
  drop_map_nth[OF Suc_leI[OF exists_0]]

lemma (in cat_k) view_eq: "view_0 = view_k"
  unfolding heard_k seen_def

  apply (subst map_append[symmetric])
  apply (rule arg_cong[where f="map _"])
  apply (rule range_app[symmetric])
  using k_max k_min less_imp_le Suc_le_eq by auto

text \<open>

Now, to prove the relevant properties about @{text view_k}, we just need to
prove them for @{text view_0}. But to do that, we need to know something
about @{term "spoken ! 0"}. We haven't yet figured out how that choice is
made, so we'll just assume it's one of the @{text candidates}:

\<close>

locale cat_0_spoken = cat_0 +
  assumes spoken_candidate_0: "spoken ! 0 \<in> candidates 0"

lemma (in cat_0_spoken)
  distinct_0: "distinct view_0" and
  set_0: "set view_0 = {0..length assigned}"
  using spoken_candidate_0 distinct_n set_n
  unfolding candidates_0 rejected_def
  by fastforce+

text \<open>

Finally, we can prove the properties we wanted for @{text view_k}, and use
them to discharge the assumptions of @{text candidates_k}.

\<close>

locale cat_k_view = cat_k + cat_0_spoken

lemma (in cat_k_view)

  by auto

lemma (in cat_k_view) candidates_k: "candidates k = {rejected, assigned ! k}"
  using candidates_i[OF k_max] distinct_k set_k by simp

text \<open>

If we additionally assumed that cat $k$ chooses one of it's @{text candidates},
but somehow avoids the @{text rejected} hat, it trivially follows that cat $k$
chooses its @{text assigned} hat. Our task now is to ensure that cat @{text k}
does indeed reject the same hat as the rearmost cat.

\<close>

section \<open>The choice function\<close>

text \<open>

We'll now derive the method the cats use to ensure all of them reject the same
hat. We assume that the cats have agreed beforehand on the algorithm each cat
will \emph{individually} apply, and have convinced themselves that the agreed
algorithm will bring them \emph{collective} success, no matter how the hats are
assigned to them.

We can represent the individual algorithm as a function of the information an
individual cat receives. We don't yet know its definition, but we can write its
type:

\<close>

type_synonym choice = "nat list \<Rightarrow> nat list \<Rightarrow> nat"

text \<open>

That is, when it is cat $k$'s turn, we give the list of calls @{text heard}
from behind, and the list of hats @{text seen} in front, both in order, and the
function returns the number the cat should call. The lengths of the lists give
the position of the cat in the line, so we can use a single function to
represent the choices of all cats, without loss of generality.

We can partially implement the @{typ choice} function, first calculating the
@{text candidates}, and deferring the remaining work to a @{text classifier}
function, which we'll take as a parameter until we know how to implement it:

\<close>

type_synonym classifier = "nat \<Rightarrow> nat list \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> nat list \<Rightarrow> bool"

locale classifier =
  fixes classify :: "classifier"

definition (in classifier)
  choice :: "choice"

lemma (in classifier) choices_length: "length (choices assigned) = length assigned"
  by (simp add: choices_def choices'_length)

text \<open>

The order in which we pass arguments to the @{typ classifier} is suggestive of
one of the two possible orderings of the full set of hats consistent with what
is @{text heard} and @{text seen} by the cat making the choice. We imagine hat
@{text b} on the cat's head, between those it has @{text heard} and @{text
seen}, and imagine hat @{text a} placed on the floor behind the rearmost cat,
where no cat can see it.

The classifier then returns a @{typ bool} that indicates whether the given
ordering should be accepted or rejected. If accepted, the cat calls the hat it
had imagined on its own head. If rejected, it calls the other.

Since there must always be exactly one correct call, we require that the
classifier accepts an ordering if and only if it would reject the alternative:

\<close>

locale classifier_swap = classifier +
  assumes classifier_swap:
    "\<And>a heard b seen.
      distinct (a # heard @ b # seen) \<Longrightarrow>
        classify a heard b seen \<longleftrightarrow> \<not> classify b heard a seen"

text \<open>

This means that we can say which is the accepted ordering, regardless of which
ordering we actually passed to the classifier.

Although its a small refinement from choice to classifier, it gives us a
different way of looking at the problem. Instead of asking what is the correct
hat number, which is different for each cat, we can consider orderings of the
complete set of hats, and whether or not those orderings are consistent with
the information available to \emph{all} of the cats.

In particular, we notice that for all but the rearmost cat to choose the
correct hats, the accepted orderings must be the same for all cats. This is
because the correct call for any cat must be what was @{text seen} by all cats
to the rear, and will also be @{text heard} by all cats towards the front.

Surprisingly, this is true even for the rearmost cat! The only thing special
about the rearmost cat is that its assigned number is irrelevant. The task of
the rearmost cat is not to guess its assigned number, but to inform the other
cats which ordering is both consistent with the information they will have, and
also accepted by the classifier.

We can write down the required property that the accepted orderings must be
consistent:

\<close>

locale classifier_consistent = classifier_swap +
  assumes classifier_consistent:
    "\<And>a heard b seen a' heard' b' seen'.
      a # heard @ b # seen = a' # heard' @ b' # seen'
        \<Longrightarrow> classify a heard b seen = classify a' heard' b' seen'"

text \<open>

So far, we have investigated some properties that a @{typ classifier} must
have, but have not thrown away any information. The classifier is given
everything known to each cat. The lengths of the arguments @{text heard} and
@{text seen} encode the cat's position in the line, so we even allow the
classifier to behave differently for each cat.

But the property @{term classifier_well_behaved} suggests that the position in
the line is redundant, and we can collapse the classifier's arguments into a
single list.
