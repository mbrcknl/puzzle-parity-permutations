## Schrödinger's cats: a puzzle about parities and permutations

Meet Schrödinger, who travels the world with an unusually clever clowder of *n*
talking cats. In their latest show, the cats stand in a line. Schrödinger asks
a volunteer (not a plant!) to take *n*+1 hats, numbered zero to *n*, and
randomly assign one to each cat, so that there is one spare. Each cat sees all
of the hats in front of it, but not its own hat, nor those behind, nor the
spare hat. The cats then take turns, each calling out a single number from the
set {0..*n*}, without repeating any number previously called, and without any
other communication. Although the first call is allowed to be wrong, the
remaining cats always call out the numbers on their own hats.

How do they do this?
